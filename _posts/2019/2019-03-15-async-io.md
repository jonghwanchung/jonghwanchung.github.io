## What is Asynchronous I/O?

> "In computer science, `asynchrnous I/O` (also **non-sequential I/O**) is a form of input/output processing that permits other processing to continue before the transmission has finishied. A name used for asynchronous I/O in the Windows API is **overlapped I/O**."

Asynchronous I/O (`AIO`) is a relatively recent addition to the Linux kernel. It's a standard feature of the 2.6 kernel, but we can find patches for 2.4. The basic idea behind AIO is ***to allow a process to initiate a number of I/O operations without having to block or wait for any to complete***". At some later time, or after being notified of I/O completion, the process can retrieve the results of the I/O.

To fully understand this concept, we need to know the most common `I/O models` that are available under Unix, Linux, and Windows.



## I/O Models

The following matrix shows basic I/O models. Each of these I/O models has usage patterns that are advantageous for particular applications. [[Image Source]](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/l-async/)

From my point of view, synchronous and asynchronous can be distinguished according to the answer of following question, "***The result of an I/O system call is correct at its return point?***".

- `Synchronous` : Yes (The correct result is received at this time.)
- `Asynchronous` : No (The correct result is received at later time, not now.)

Also, blocking and non-blocking differ the point of "***An I/O system call is blocked or waited for its completion?***".

- `Blocking` : Yes (It is blocked and waited for completion.)
- `Non-blocking` : No (It returns immediately with the an error code; EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.)



### Synchronous & blocking I/O
In this model, the user-space application performs a system call that results in the application blocking. This means that the application blocks until the system call is complete (data transferred or error). And, when the system call is returned, the result is the right value for it. This work flow is described in the following figure:

### Synchronous & non-blocking I/O
To use this model, first of all, a device (`file descriptor`; files and sockets) is opened as non-blocking. In Linux system, it can be performed by setting the `FIONBIO` flag on `ioctl()`. By doing this, instead of completing an I/O immediately, a system call returns an error code indicating that the command could not be immediately satisfied (`EAGAIN` or `EWOULDBLOCK`), as shown in the following figure.

This approach can be inefficient due to the following reasons.

- `busy-wait` : the application must busy-wait until the data is available. It attempts to check whether the data is available.
- `latency` : there is a gap between the data becoming available in the kernel and the user calling.



### Asynchronous & blocking I/O
It is an another blocking paradigm that imitates asynchronous I/O system calls with `blocking notification` such as `select()`, `poll()`, and `epoll()`. The blocking notification system is used to determine when there's any activity for an entrolled descriptor. It provides the notification service for not just one desscriptor, but many. So, it notifies these descriptors' ability to write data and read data, and also whether an error has occured. The notification system is based on the data structure of kernel (`inode`).

<span style="font-size:80%">Typical flow of the asynchronous blocking I/O model (select)</span> [[src]](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/l-async/)



Due to the primary issue (inefficiency) with the `select()`, its use for high-performance I/O is not advised.



### Asynchronous & non-blocking I/O
It is one of `overlapping processing` with I/O. An I/O system call returns immediately, indicating that the request was successfully initiated. The application can then perform other processing while the background operation completes. When the task is completed, a `signal` or `thread-based callback` is generated to complete the I/O transaction.

<span style="font-size:80%">Typical flow of the asynchronous non-blocking I/O model</span> [[src]](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/l-async/)



The ability to overlap I/O processing in a single process for potentially multiple I/O requests exploits the gap between processing speed and I/O speed. While one or more slow I/O requests are pending, the CPU can perform other tasks.



## Conclusion

From the previous taxonomy of I/O models, The blocking models require the application to block when I/O has started. It means that it is NOT possible to overlap processing and I/O at the same time. Whereas, the synchronous & non-blocking model allows overlap of processing and I/O, but it requires that the application check the status of the I/O on a recurring basis. This leaves asynchronous & non-blocking I/O, which permits overlap of processing and I/O, including notification of I/O completion.



## What to learn next?

- [I/O Multiplexing](http://personal.denison.edu/~bressoud/cs375-s13/supplements/linux_altIO.pdf)
   - A mechanism that processes multiple input/output events from a single event loop, with system calls like select (Unix) and poll/epoll (Linux).

- [AIO for Linux](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/aio.7.html)
   - The POSIX asynchronous I/O (AIO) interface that allows Linux applicatoins to initiate one or more I/O operations that are performed asynchronously.
